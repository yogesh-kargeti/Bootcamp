Q1. Explain the concept of shuffling and sorting in MapReduce.
Ans. Shuffle phase in Hadoop transfers the map output from Mapper to a Reducer in MapReduce.It is the process by which the system performs the sort and transfers the map output to the reducer as input. So, MapReduce shuffle phase is necessary for the reducers else it will have no input. The keys generated by the mapper are automatically sorted by MapReduce Framework. Sorting in Hadoop helps reducer to easily distinguish when a new reduce task should start.

Q2. What is the role of combiner and partitioner in MapReduce?
Ans. The Combiner is used in between the Mapper and the Reducer to reduce the volume of data transfer between Map and Reduce. The output produced by the Mapper is the intermediate output in terms of key-value pairs which is massive in size. A Combiner summarizes the map output records with the same key.
Partitioner allows distributing how outputs from the map stage are send to the reducers. Partitioner controls the keys partition of the intermediate map-outputs.The total number of partitions is almost same as the number of reduce tasks for the job.
